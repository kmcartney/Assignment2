to make it look glamorous on her instagram- so this is an opportunity to poke a little fun at myself
for that.</span></span>

    <td>my cat wakes me up just to take up
       most of my bed like this. While he
       may look adorable here, he bit me right
       after I took this video.</td>
    <td>it took me way too many tries to get this video right.
      Breakfast was cold by the time i got to eat it.</td>
    <td>After breakfast I try to fill our my planner
      for the rest of the week. I've hand made my planners
       for the last few years so I can plan my week, track
       my good and bad habits and sometimes plan my day by the hour.<p>
       I draw out the entire week every Tuesday.
       It would probably just be easier to buy a planner
       but I am very picky. My planner is pretty much the only
       thing that keeps me sane and on track through the school year.</td>

            homework thats due later in the week. Yes, i definitely
            should have done more of it over the weekend.
            I have hand letters on Wednesdays so I spend most of my
            Tuesdays working on that.<p>
            This week my Hand Letters assignment was to work on an
            alphabet with the theme "seasons."  I chose to do a
            summer fruits and veggies alphabet in watercolor.</td>

      I make myself dinner for the rest of the week,
      as a method of procrastination from other work
      I should be doing.  This week I made pasta and
      meatballs with red sauce.</td>
    <td>It takes way too long to make dinner for the
       week  so I usually snack while I cook. By the
        time I can sit down and eat the food I made,
        i'm too full from snacks.</td>
    <td>I usually end my night by answering emails
      and watching Law & Order: SVU. I scare myself
       from that so I have to watch The Office to
       fall asleep.</td>
