to make it look glamorous on her instagram- so this is an opportunity to poke a little fun at myself
for that.</span></span>

       for the last few years so I can plan my week, track
       my good and bad habits and sometimes plan my day by the hour.<p>
       I draw out the entire week every Tuesday.
       It would probably just be easier to buy a planner
       but I am very picky. My planner is pretty much the only
       thing that keeps me sane and on track through the school year.</div></td></tr>
